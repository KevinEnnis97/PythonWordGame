<h2>Welcome to Word Game on the Web</h2>
<h4>How to play...</h4>
<p>You will be provided with a word of seven letters or more which we'll call the "source_word". You are then to think up seven three-or-more letter words made up from the letters contained within the source_word, ensuring that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Each word is only made up from the letters contained within the source word.</li>
  <li>Each word exists within the dictionary (i.e., it's a “real” word).</li>
  <li>The words all have three letters or more.</li>
  <li>There are no duplicate words.</li>
  <li>None of the seven words is the source word. </li>
  <li>And don't forget: case is NOT significiant (Pet, PET, and pet are the *same* word).</li>
</ul>
