in pbarry, different behaviour with browser forward and back
  "done" session var
  - v2. kinda have this done but pressing browser froward button warns about "confirm form resubmission"...
      -or if going back from score page...not good :/
  - even on winner screen, clicking on record score again doesnt bring you back to the score page if you already saw it
  - form submissions everywhere... (something to do with methods and request.methodÂ¿)


which errors are more important? (if you have all 8, which show up. currently for me i will show all, pb does it different))
  -word count + invalid letters + misspelt words

can you use the same letter multiple times?
  - no it is invalid leteter

using database, should do it like this: # http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/patterns/sqlite3/
  - you just use json/pickle?...(dont worry about multiple users)

improvment ideas:
  new error if not using alphabet characters
  replace manual counter with collections counter
  refresh on winner changes time (same as pb)

with json sometimes the scores gets cleared??
